          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
          The mitochondria is an organelle in all eukaryotic cells, like human skin cells or plant cells. 
          The mitochrondria is used to perform cellular respiration. </p>
          <h3>Properties of the Mitochondria</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>double membrance</li>
            <li>found in multicellular organisms</li>
            <li>contains its own DNA</li>
            <li>mitochrondrion (singular), mitochrondria (plural)</li>
          </ul>    
          <h3>Cellular Respiration</h3>
          <p>Cellular respiration is a chemical process that takes place in eukaryotic cells. It's purpose is to convert 
            nutrients into energy. Cellular respiration happens in the mitochrondria. It converts carbohydrates in the form 
            of glucose and oxygen molecules into carbon dioxide, water, and energy which is stored in the form of ATP. 
            ATP stands for adenosine triphospate. During cellular respiration, around 36 ATP are produced.
             This ATP can then be sent to another part of the cell to trasnfer its energy. Cellular respiration produces energy for
            the cell to use. This is why the mitochrondria is the powerhouse of the cell.</p>
